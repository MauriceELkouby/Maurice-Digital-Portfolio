                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in <em>Montreal</em>, where I developed an early fascination with technology through scratch.mit.edu, robotics competitions and arduino circuitry</p>

                <p>In cegep I went for a hands on approach to learning and dived into the 3 year Electrical Engineering technology: Automation and Control. During my studies, I participated in several hands-on projects that sparked my interest in factory automation and simulation technologies. I was accepted and am enrolled in the ETS Automation engineering bachelor's program that I will be starting September 2025</p>
