            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Hello, I'm <strong>Maurice Elkouby</strong>, a passionate technologist in the field of engineering and automation. With a keen interest in improving manufacturing efficiency, my goal is to specialize in using cutting-edge 3D simulation tools to optimize workflows and reduce costs. My goal is to combine technical expertise with real-world applications to help companies grow through smarter automation solutions.</p>

            <section class="early-life">
                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in <em>Montreal</em>, where I developed an early fascination with technology with starting programming with scratch.mit.edu at the early age of 8, robotics competitions at 10 and arduino circuitry at 12.</p>

                </div>

                <p>I then continued on to Royal West where I took technology complementaries, participated in robotics club and in honor band.</p>

                </div>

                <p>In cegep I went for a hands on approach to learning and dived into the 3 year Electrical Engineering technology: Automation and Control. During my studies, I participated in several hands-on projects that sparked my interest in factory automation and simulation technologies.</p>

            <section class="Personal Interests">
                <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
                <p>I played piano to a 9th grade RCM level, which gave me a strong fundemental of sound design useful for making my own tracks and teaching.</p>
                <p>I enjoy reading fantasy books, currently waiting on the 6th book of Game of Thrones.</p>
                <p>I enjoy being outdoors, wether it's skating, hiking and epecially fishing</p>
                <p>I make personal coding projects and participate in GameJams.</p>
